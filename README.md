# This code is for Raspberry Pi tested on Pi 4
# It is considering the usage of externals DS18B20 temp sensor connected as parasite
# This code will look for all temperature sensors under /sys/bus/w1/device starting with string 28
# Instructions to setup hardware and OS to detect the sensors at https://github.com/deividfoggi/Temperature_RaspberryPi4_DS18B20
